# Advent Of Code 2025

To run the scripts, install GNU-APL (e.g. `brew install gnu-apl` on OSX) and
then do e.g. `./aoc3a.apl`

Each script prints the output for the test data, and then for the full data.
Errors about a missing server can be safely ignored, apparently.

`aoc2a.apl` is awkward and `aoc2b.apl` is just foolish.
In both of them, the `overlaps` function is wrong!
There is a working version in `aoc5b.apl`, which is the first
place it was actually needed.

`aoc8b.apl` has a cleaner version of the circuit builder than `aoc8a.apl`

`aoc9b.apl` took ~ 15 minutes to run on a 2024 Macbook Pro; the selected square is shown in `aoc9b_plot.png`
